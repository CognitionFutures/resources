# Cognitive Modeling Greatest Hits
This is a list of cognitive modeling papers solicited from a wide range of cognitive modelers, by asking them the following: "I wonder if you would do me the honor of sending me a list of your top 2-5 favorite cognitive modeling papers. I would expect that 1-3 of these would be your papers, and 1-3 would be someone else's. I am looking for papers where someone really nailed the phenomenon, whatever it is. I would lean towards more recent papers, but oldies but goodies are ok too."

At the bottom of this list are some of the comments received with the papers, organized by the name of the respondent. Please let me know if any of the links are broken: gary@ucsd.edu

Remarks by Researchers in Cognitive Science

    Morten Christiansen
    Dell et al (1997): "A brilliant example of how models can be used to make predictions for new data collection (for specific individuals)!"
    St. Clair et al (2010): "A recent paper of mine exploring limitations of a past model (Mintz) and proposing a new model of how kids might learn about lexical categories (combining corpus analyses of child-directed speech and connectionist models)."
    MacDonald, M.C. & Christiansen, M.H. (2002). Reassessing working memory: A comment on Just & Carpenter (1992) and Waters & Caplan (1996). Psychological Review, 109, 35-54. "showed how working memory capacity effects can be explained by experience with language"
    Christiansen, M.H., Allen, J. & Seidenberg, M.S. (1998). Learning to segment speech using multiple cues: A connectionist model. Language and Cognitive Processes, 13, 221-268. "first comprehensive multiple-cue integration model in the context of word segmentation"
    Christiansen, M.H. & Chater, N. (1999). Toward a connectionist model of recursion in human linguistic performance. Cognitive Science, 23, 157-205.
    "A model of complex recursion before Hauser, Chomsky & Fitch made the topic popular again"
    Axel Cleeremans
    Elman (1990), Cleeremans & McClelland (1991), and Munakata et al (1997): "All of these have to do with the SRN and in each case, I feel that something has been nailed indeed: the general idea and power of limited recurrence in the first paper; the application to sequence learning in the second; and to cognitive development in the third."
    Hinton (1986): "This is the first connectionist paper I read. This is truly seminal I think in showing key concepts from distributed representations to functional similarity as well as from analyzing hidden units activity to watching abstract concepts emerge out of mere processing."
    Plaut & Shallice (2003): "This is a truly insightful paper about how you can get double, graded dissociations out of a single system. I always use it in class as an illustration of the pitfalls of standard neuropsychological thinking."

        Gary Dell

    My current favorites are Elman (1991, grammatical structure SRN paper); Plaut & Shallice (1993, Cog Neuroscience), and McClelland, McNaughton, &     O'Reilly (1995). For my papers, I like Chang, Dell & Bock, 2006) and Dell, Burger & Svec (1997).

    As for the paper that you've requested (Dell, Schwartz et al., 1997), the pdf is already on your list, as are these other papers. So, I'm afraid that I can't really expand on your list. I'm still an old connectionist fogey.

    Simon Dennis
    Dennis & Humphreys (2001): "This is the paper that nailed how they ought to be modified ;-)."
    Elman (1991): "It was just such a different way of looking at language structure and really emphasised the power of statistics."
    Henson (1998): "Conclusively shows that simple chaining models cannot be an accurate portrayal of serial recall and proposes the Start End model."
    Landauer & Dumais (1997): "This one also was just very surprising. It taught me that toy examples are not good enough. Sometimes what we think is a complicated process is really just big data. And you can't see it if your corpus is restricted to 'man eats. woman eats ...'."
    Ratcliff et al (1990) and Shiffrin et al (1990): "It isn't often that one really has to concede defeat and move on. There is normally some kind of wiggle room. The List Strength Effect just didn't give any. The Global Matching Models were all demonstrably wrong and had to be fundamentally modified."
    Robert French
    French et al (2004): "This paper has had a fair amount of success and clearly illustrates, I think, the importance of modeling as a tool for understanding human behavior."
    Kanerva (1985): "This is a simple, absolutely clear presentation of sparse distributed memory. In fact it is the clearest description of SDM that I know of. His book, Sparse Distributed Memory, "mathematized" everything in any attempt to put it all on a formal footing and, in so doing, lost a lot of potential fans. This paper is simple, clear, and lends itself perfectly to implementation. It's impossible to find on the Web, however."
    David Huber
    Nosofsky (1986): "I think there's no better example of a model that nailed the phenomenon of interest."
    Nosofsky (1984): "His GCM model gave rise to everything that has followed in the study of categorization and it's still a valid contender to this day. But, more importantly, it changed the way that people model by forcing them to consider both representation (as revealed by MDS in this case) and the process (feature attention) simultaneously. Subsequently, John Kruschke demonstrated that GCM is mathematically identical to his ALCOVE neural network model."
    Bradley Love
    Roberts & Pashler (2000): "This paper is a good conceptual overview of why fit is not enough and motivates model selection statistics (proper model testing)."
    Sanborn et al (2010): "This paper is a really nice linkage of process and rational models with intuitive explanations of Gibbs sampling and particle filters"
    Daw et al (2006): "This is a good introduction to Reinforcement Leaning (RL) models and using cognitive models to interpret fMRI data."
    Mitchell et al (2008): "This is a fun paper with cool twist on 'mind reading'."
    Shiffrin et al (2008): "This is a nice and easy to understand overview of Bayesian methods (model selection)."
    Michael Mozer
    McClelland & Rumelhart (1981): "It's a classic, and probably nobody covers it anymore, and it probably wins an award as the model that was recycled more times than any other-with its units relabeled-to explain other phenomena."
    Najemnik & Geisler (2005): "It takes some decoding to figure out but it seems like a really pretty and believable Bayesian account that takes into account limitations of the visual system (falloff of acuity with retinal eccentricity)."
    Richard Shiffrin
    Huber et al (2001): "The model kept predicting correctly in study after study even though our intuitions kept leading us to expect other results."
    Michael Spivey
    Allopenna et al (1998): "They used McClelland and Elman's (1986) TRACE interactive-activation model to make remarkable time-course predictions of eye-movement patterns during spoken word recognition in a visual context."
    McRae et al (1998): "We built a normalized version of an interactive-activation network to simulate the nonlinearities inherent in "the garden-path effect", where syntactically ambiguous sentences cause slowed reading times, due to a constraint-satisfaction process (rather than a stage-based modular syntax process)."

Angela Yu
Wanted to add
Dayan, P, Hinton, GE, Neal, RM & Zemel, RS (1995). The Helmholtz machine.  Neural Computation, 7, 889-904. pdf
but I did not include it because it is not modeling any particular data. Angela's response: "Personally I feel like it is an important theoretical constructs worth teaching/learning.  After all, any model can fit data, whether good or bad, bit only a few (good ones) can generalize across experimental settings and levels of analysis."
